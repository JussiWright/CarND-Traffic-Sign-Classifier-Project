### Analyze Performance

Seven out of eight the extra pictures were classified correctly.
The percentage of detection was somewhat suspicious in the case of the seven images. 

The images were mostly clear and therefore easily recognizable. Identification deteriorates if the images are too dark or overexposed. The detection is also weakened if the area you are identifying is partially cut off or the angle of view is too sideways
